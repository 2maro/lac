### Instructions
A major aspect of this course is to intake, comprehend, and discuss the assigned topics. Take the time
to fully absorb each topic and contribute to the discussion thread by sharing your thoughts. Interaction
with peers is also expected; the goal is to compare and contrast ideas to build a solid foundation of
knowledge.
#### Discussion Post #1
Scan the chapter here 

(TODO)
#link("https://google.github.io/building-secure-and-reliable-systems/raw/ch17.
html")* \

for keywords and pull out what you think will help you to better understand how to triage an
incident.
Read the section called “Operation Security” in this same chapter: *#link("https://google.github.io/
building-secure-and-reliable-systems/raw/ch17.html")* \
what important concepts do you learn about how we behave during an operational response to an incident?

## Digging Deeper
1. If uptime is so important to us, why is it so important to us to also understand how our systems can
fail? Why would we focus on the thing that does not drive uptime?
2. Start reading about SLOs: https://sre.google/workbook/implementing-slos/
How does this help you operationally? Does it make sense that keeping systems within defined parameters
will help keep them operating longer?

## Reflection Questions
1. What questions do you still have about this week?
2. How are you going to use what you’ve learned in your current role?
